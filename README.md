# RemoveRedditAffilliate
This is a userscript for removing reddit affiliate links


This forces affiliate links to be the actual link you expect them to be.

Also removes reddits outbound url redirection to out.reddit.com and replaces it to be the actual link


When ever a link is replaced with this script the link is changed to the color Green (#00FF00)
