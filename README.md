# RemoveRedditTracking
This is a userscript for removing reddit tracking links


Requires a addon that can use userscripts

[GreaseMonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/ "GreaseMonkey for Firefox")


[TamperMonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en "TamperMonkey for Chrome")

This forces links to remove the tracking that reddit places inside them

* Removes reddits affiliate links (Reddit removed affiliate links but its still in there)
* Removes reddits outbound url tracker
* Removes reddits inbound url tracker


OPTIONAL:

Change ChangeColorOnEdit to true for this

When ever a link is replaced with this script the link is changed to the color Green (#00FF00)
